# windows7_password_changer
This is a GUI application that allows you to change a windows 7 pc password, without knowing the current password. I created this application  shortly after Windows 7 was realeased.

This application will only work for Windows 7.
This application should not be used for any malicious actions.

What it does:
It basically just gives you an easy way for changing a password without having to remember the CMD command yourself.

This is a netbeans project. Should you wish to alter it, you will have to open it in netbeans. If you like, you could create your own GUI and open it with any IDE.
